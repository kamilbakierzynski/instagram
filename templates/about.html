            <p>It's an instagram bot so be careful while using! Instagram does not like bots and often bans them.
              Keep in mind that following large amount of accounts over and over will surely trigger Instagram anti-bot scripts.
              These program can still have many bugs that couldn't be found during testing so if you've found one please report it 
              by adding an issue on Github repository. This program it's not lightening fast due to the fact that it uses web scraping for
              collecting data rather than API. Most of the time the action time needed is proportional to your account size, so if you
              have a big one - be patient. All in all I hope this small software will help you. If you have any ideas how to improve this project, want
              to support it or simply describe your feeling feel free to contact me on Github.
